## Installation Guidelines

### **Prerequisite**

Make sure you have the following tools, installed on your system.

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

**Step 1. Clone the repository:**
Open gitbash in your desired directory and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/justEhmadSaeed/CS311S20PID08.git
```

**Step 2. Open Two Terminals:**

- Set path of the first terminal to the root of the project folder, that would have /CS311S20PID08 at the end of the path. This terminal will operate the **frontend** of the project.
- For the second terminal, set its path to the **backend** folder, located in the root directory, or you can initialize its path from the root directory, which will have the same path as of the first terminal and then you can run the following command to set its path to the backend folder.

```
cd backend
```

**Step 3. Install the required npm Packages/ dependencies:**

To install the dependencies of both frontend and backend, run the following command in both terminals:

```
npm install
```

Make sure you run the above-mentioned command for both terminals without any errors.

**Step 4. Run the project:**

Now assuming that your system has all the dependencies required to run the project, it is now set to run over your system.

Now for the final step, run the following command in both terminals to start the project:

```
npm start
```

The link for the application will appear in the frontend terminal.

For the next time, you have to follow steps 2 & 4 only.
